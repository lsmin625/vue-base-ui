# UI Framework for Vue-based Web Applications

## Overview
With the modern shift in web service architecture, many systems now leverage REST APIs provided by the backend while implementing reactive frameworks on the frontend. This separation of frontend and backend components calls for an independent UI framework capable of handling common web service concerns, which is essential in a decoupled service environment. 

This UI framework is designed to support frontend application development across various services by utilizing a minimal set of BFF (Backend For Frontend) APIs. Our goal is to offer the necessary tools and environment for developing versatile frontend UI applications.

### Key Considerations
- **Large-scale Web Systems**: The framework should be suitable for applications with complex requirements and high user demand.
- **Diverse Developer Levels**: Designed to be approachable by both beginner and experienced developers, the framework prioritizes ease of use and flexibility.
- **Learning Curve**: Minimizes the learning curve to facilitate rapid onboarding and efficient development.
- **Common Component Implementation and Utilization**: Includes reusable common components to streamline development across projects.
- **Build/Deployment Performance**: Optimized for fast builds and efficient deployment processes to reduce time-to-market.

## Key Technologies

### Vite Package Manager
Vite is a fast, modern development environment and build tool for Vue-based projects. It offers:
- Lightning-fast builds and hot module replacement (HMR).
- Efficient dependency management that improves build performance.
- Optimized production build with tree-shaking and code splitting.

### Vue Framework
Vue provides a reactive, component-based architecture that simplifies complex UIs and enhances interactivity:
- A reactive core design that enables dynamic UI updates with minimal code.
- Modular, component-based structure for reusability and maintainability.
- Rich ecosystem and compatibility with tools like Vite, Vue Router, and Vuex, empowering seamless development for various project requirements.

## Application Development Tools

| Tool        | Purpose                                        |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Node/NPM** | JavaScript runtime environment and dependency management |
| **VS Code** | IDE for Web UI development                    |

## Running the Framework

To set up and run the UI framework:
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start the development server: `npm run dev`

## Application Package Structure

| Directory/File   | Description                            | Notes                     |
|------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| `src/`           | Main source files for the application  | Contains all core logic   |
| `public/`        | Public assets (e.g., icons, images)    | Served as static files    |
| `components/`    | Vue components for UI elements         | Reusable across modules   |
| `views/`         | Page-level Vue components              | Represents application views |
| `router/`        | Vue Router setup and route definitions | Handles page navigation   |
| `store/`         | Vuex state management                  | Centralized state management |

This documentation provides a comprehensive guide for understanding and using the Vue-based UI framework, facilitating a smoother development process in the context of modern, decoupled web services.
